                <p>
                  It all began with a desperate phone call late one evening. A local primary school had fallen victim to a devastating virus attack.
                  Their systems were down, student records were inaccessible, and they were facing the prospect of having to close their doors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What started as a late-night rescue mission turned into something much bigger. As we worked to restore their systems,
                  we realized the broader challenges that community organizations face when it comes to technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That experience sparked a movement. Friends and IT professionals came together, united by a shared vision:
                  to make technology accessible and affordable for the organizations that serve our communities.
